Students explore how courts balance individual privacy with the need for government action in the investigation of crime, and the dictates and limitations of the exclusionary rule in shaping police conduct. We evaluate how the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in Terry v. Ohio sanctioned stop and frisk procedures that perpetually lead to disproportionate outcomes in who is investigated and arrested, and examine efforts towards more equitable policing.  Additionally, students meet with and get the opportunity to observe practitioners and judges who work in motions practice on Fourth Amendment issues.

 ,Sub link Page,Course Descriptions - Politics  | Lake Forest College,"(Senior Seminar in American Politics and Law: Searches, Seizures, and Security). The right against government intrusion into our lives is one of our most cherished freedoms found in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution. The framers believed that agents of government should not enter private homes or search personal property without justification. Yet now, government entities and corporations have access to our personal information raising questions of how current law, politics, and security issues at home and abroad reshape constitutional boundaries of our right to privacy. This course begins with a study of the Fourth Amendment and constitutional rights and limitations of search and seizure and continues with a review of current law affecting our national security. This course is a capstone course for politics majors and students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of the instructor.

 ,Sub link Page,Global Fake News and Defamation Symposium | Southwestern Law School,"""Weaponized defamation” refers to the increasing invocation, and increasing use, of defamation and privacy torts by people in power to threaten press investigations, despite laws protecting responsible or non-reckless reporting. In the United States, for example, some politicians, including the current president, invoke defamation as both a sword and shield. Armed with legal power that individuals—and most news organizations—cannot match, politicians and celebrities, wealthy or backed by the wealth of others, can threaten press watchdogs with resource-sapping litigation; at the same time, some leaders appear to leverage their “lawyered-up” legal teams to make knowingly false attacks—or recklessly repeat the false attacks of others—with impunity."

The private rules of the national and international sports world as established by organizations such as the NFL, NBA, NHL, UFC and the IOC form the main governing body of the sports industry, along with labor law, contract law, competition or antitrust law, and tort law. Issues like defamation and privacy rights also represent fundamental aspects of the business."

Further, the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act mandates the annual disclosure of statistics of sexual offenses known to have occurred within the law school’s jurisdiction. The victim’s name will not be disclosed in any such reporting."

","Content:  This course provides an introduction to the basic individual liberty issues in constitutional law:  issues related to the restrictions on the manner in which federal, state and local government officials treat ""the governed.""  These specific topics are covered:  freedom of speech; freedom of press; freedom of religion; equal protection, particularly as it relates to racial discrimination and affirmative action; procedural due process; and rights to privacy and substantive due process.

Sequence and Prerequisites:  This is an elective upper-class course.  Students taking Constitutional Law II must already have taken Constitutional Law I, or with the instructor's permission they may take both courses concurrently.

Many upper-class courses discuss subjects for which Constitutional Law II provides a foundation (Criminal Procedure I; Administrative & Legislative Law; Advanced Criminal Justice; American Legal History; Children and the Law; Criminal Procedure II; Family Law; First Amendment; Labor Law; Law and the Political System), so it is a good idea to take Constitutional Law II (and, therefore, Constitutional Law I) early on in a student's upper-class course schedule.

Relationship to Law Practice:  A knowledge of the issues examined in Constitutional Law II is very helpful to any practitioner working for a federal or state governmental agency or representing clients who have matters involving these governmental agencies.  (This includes practitioners in such seemingly ""private law"" fields as land use and property disposition, representation of corporate entities, personal injury practice involving workers compensation schemes, etc.)

In addition, Constitutional Law II is taught through a methodology emphasizing problem-solving and critical analysis and argumentation.  These generic skills are broadly useful to all legal practitioners.

The materials in Constitutional Law II are given significant weight on the MultiState Bar Exam, and are often tested in the essay portion of bar exams, including the California Bar Exam.  (Materials relating to Constitutional Law II have been tested on the Performance Exam portion of the California Bar Exam.)  It is the experience of most students that the materials in Constitutional Law II are difficult to learn for the first time during bar exam preparation.

","Content:  This seminar examines current controversies on the ""cutting edge"" of United States constitutional law.  Particular focus is placed upon important questions of governmental power and individual liberties now awaiting (or on their way to) decision by the United States Supreme Court.  The first several weeks of the course introduce Supreme Court decision-making procedures and explore an area of constitutional law under serious re-examination in the courts or the body politic (for example, abortion and privacy rights, or the powers of Congress and the President).  During the remaining course sessions, students play the roles of Supreme Court justices and of advocates appearing before them.  Each class session focuses upon a case actually on review before the Court, simulating oral argument and case conference phases.Each student writes several short memoranda appropriate to the role-playing, and drafts one portion of a majority or dissenting opinion for a case under study.  (At their option, students who have not already completed the SW requirements may research and write an SW paper in lieu of the majority or dissenting opinion assignment.)Sequence and Prerequisites:  Constitutional Law I is prerequisite, unless the instructor gives special permission for Constitutional Law I to be taken concurrently.  Constitutional Law II is helpful.In electing the SW option, students should keep in mind that the scholarly writing process involves a significant expenditure of time on a multi-phase process.  Relationship to Law Practice:  This class is particularly useful for students planning practices in which constitutional law questions will play a significant role (see discussion under ""Constitutional Law I"").  In addition, the class provides advanced training in legal research and advocacy."

","Content:  This course provides a basic overview of the most common issues to arise in the relationship between an individual and an employer.  The general structure of the course will follow the employment relationship from beginning to end, discussing such issues as the hiring process; discrimination in employment; wage and hour rules; employee privacy and freedom of expression; workplace health and safety; wrongful discharge; and post-employment restrictions on employees.  This course will be taught with a strong emphasis on the practical and strategic aspects of doctrines that are covered, focusing not only on the legal elements of such doctrines, but also on the real-world applications of these doctrines, including how these doctrines affect – and are affected by – changes in the modern workplace.
 
Sequence and Prerequisites:  No prerequisites.  Employment law is one of a three-course group including Employment Discrimination and Labor Law which together provide a basic and comprehensive preparation to practice in this area.  Courses may be taken in any sequence.  
 
Relationship to Law Practice:  Employment law is one of the fastest growing areas of practice and is a subject matter that general practitioners are likely to encounter frequently.  It also is a very complex area of the law, with an enormous number of statutes and interlinking common law doctrines, making it virtually impossible to practice competently without prior course work.  An employment practice can range from government employment to solo practitioner work to firm practice to working as in-house counsel, among other options.

","Content: This course examines cutting edge issues that arise at the intersection of social media technologies and the law. These technologies include social networks, wikis, blogs, podcasts, mashups, virtual worlds, and online video/image/audio sharing websites. Popular examples of these services include Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Youtube, and Wikipedia, which enable users to communicate, share and distribute content in unprecedented ways. With a particular focus on these social media services that rely heavily on user generated content (UGC), this course will provide a foundation for understanding the state of the law regarding these technologies. The areas of law that touch social media are vast, ranging from Intellectual Property, to free speech, to privacy, to contract, to many other areas of law. This course highlights the unique applications of law to social media that result from both the nature of the technologies involved, as well as from specific legal frameworks designed to treat social media and the Internet in unique ways. The course will emphasize recent and upcoming cases, unresolved questions, and scenarios students are likely face as attorneys.  The specific learning outcomes for this course are included at the end of this document, and will be discussed explicitly in our first class."

","From employment and housing opportunities to politics and social networking, decisions made using personal data are affecting our lives in intimate ways. The increasing availability of data has the potential to create vast financial and social benefits, but could also harm interests in areas such as fairness, freedom, security, privacy, and preventing discrimination. This course is designed to introduce students to the legal, policy, and ethical issues that arise from the collection, aggregation, use, and analysis of big data, and examines responses to address these unintended consequences. The course will discuss examples from real world controversies, including the use of data by Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube. The seminar depends on contributions and discussion to facilitate understanding of different perspectives. Each student will be required to actively engage and participate."

","Content: This course explores the interaction between scientific/medical advances and the law.  Often the law lags behind scientific and medical developments.  One historical example is the rise and fall of nuclear energy – which came about, in large part, through a failed interaction between science and the law.  Recent examples include sequencing of the human genome and assisted reproductive technology.  These developments in the scientific and medical worlds potentially create legal issues, including, for example, privacy concerns.  This course addresses how these problems arise and explores the ways to approach the scientific, medical and legal landscapes.  No background in science or medicine is necessary.

","With the rapid growth of technology, Privacy Law is more relevant than ever.  Privacy is a central social and legal issue in the interconnected world we live in.  The challenge is balancing privacy rights while enabling businesses and technological innovation.  This course will familiarize students with the legal issues arising from conflicting interests in data privacy and its business uses, in particular in the areas of commerce and consumer data, health privacy, children’s privacy, employment issues and data breaches. The class focuses on the main concepts of privacy law, exploring domestic and international laws.   This is an experiential class that will provide students with a hands-on approach and expose each student to the practical considerations faced by those working in the privacy field and provide opportunities for students to self-assess as part of the learning process.

","Course Description: This seminar explores Reproductive Justice (""RJ"") as a paradigm for understanding reproductive oppression--that is, the subordination of individuals through their bodies, sexualities, and abilities to reproduce. The RJ paradigm picks up where a reproductive rights framework ends. It contends that the fight for equality and dignity in matters relating to reproduction continues beyond a successful argument that the Constitution ought to protect a ""right” to privacy, ""right"" to access contraception, or ""right"" to an abortion.

An RJ framework observes that ""rights"" are given meaning - and lose meaning - according to the race, class, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, immigration status, and physical and mental ability (among other attributes) of the rights bearer. As such, RJ analyzes reproductive experiences within a complex context and with respect to the multiple statuses of the persons involved. This seminar will explore RJ as it speaks to assisted reproductive technologies, health care policy, immigration, incarceration, environmental justice, and economic inequality, among other topics."

Many times, data are available in aggregated form so it is difficult to use them. Some datasets such as from utilities have privacy issues. Similarly, data from one domain are not easily available to experts in other domains. There may be an opportunity to create a catalog of all available data including the granularity of the data, their sources and ways to access them. Accomplishing this may require standard protocols for data collection, storage and dissemination. This will also require a better understanding of the intertwined nature of a complex urban system so data from one system can be useful in another."

Southern California Institute of Architecture,Sub link Page,B.Arch Course Catalog - SCI-Arc,"Students engage contemporary urban programs like creative office spaces as they include social considerations of common space, sequences of movement and pause, and privacy in their design repertoire. Reimagining the current world of the workplace from the inside out, the course is broken into four faculty sections that each offer different typological and formal approaches on the same program. All sections emphasize workflows that move between analog forms of making and digital forms of modeling to continue to cultivate experimentation and authorship. Assignments will focus on the building section or cut as a way to visualize, create, and alter an architectural intervention, which is ultimately communicated in the form of stop-motion animated narratives."
 ,Sub link Page,B.Arch Course Catalog - SCI-Arc,"The focus is on the design opportunities of cellularity and repetition, which are examined at the scale of an individual unit, a cluster of units, and a collection of clusters. Tasked with developing integrated proposals for an ordered, sequential program like that of a large housing complex or a high-rise, students are encouraged to design with an understanding of the dynamic and interdependent forces of economies, access, privacy, and infrastructure that affect these projects and their presence in the city. Case studies will be analyzed to understand how architecture can either cooperate with or operate independently from such vectors in the construction of novel architectural aesthetics. Continued emphasis will be placed on critical thinking skills, oral and visual communication, and the development of individual leadership qualities. "

We started out in the Barn, a student recreation center. Then we headed into the dorms, which I thought were awesome because they have their own kitchen and bathroom. They’re like a small apartment. Plenty of room and privacy. We then visited the Tech Center where I saw the different labs and classrooms I would be in. It was exactly what I wanted - hands on.  The Rambo Center was our next stop. I saw all of the general education classrooms. I was surprised and thrilled at the small class size!  The college was what it appeared to be on their website, there was no misrepresentation; I felt I could trust them.   I felt comfortable that I would receive the education and career they noted."

 ,Sub link Page, ,"If a reporting party is unsure of a College official’s duties and ability to maintain privacy and/or confidentiality, ask her/him before discussing the incident of concern with her/him. S/he will be able to explain and help a reporting party to make decisions about who is in the best position to help. All resources, except those specifically exempted from doing so, are instructed to share limited incident reports with their supervisors and/or the College’s Coordinator of Equity & Compliance. If personally identifiable information is shared, it will be shared with as few people as possible and all efforts will be made to protect privacy to the greatest possible extent."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"A party bringing a grievance(s) is encouraged to speak to the College’s Coordinator of Equity & Compliance or a member of the College’s Equity Grievance Panel (see membership list below) to make formal reports of incidents of sexual misconduct. A party bringing a grievance(s) has the right, and can expect, to have grievances taken seriously by the College when formally reported and to have those incidents affords privacy to the reporter, and only a small group of officials who need to know will be told. Information will be shared as necessary with investigators, witnesses and the responding party. The circle of people with this knowledge will be kept as tight as possible to preserve a party bringing a grievance’s rights and privacy. Additionally safe and anonymous reports, which do not trigger investigations, can be made by victims and/or third parties using an online reporting form, if such mechanism is available, by using the designated reporting form."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"The privacy of all parties to a complaint of sexual misconduct must be respected, except insofar as it interferes with the College’s obligation to fully investigate allegations of sexual misconduct. Where privacy is not strictly kept, it will still be tightly controlled on a need-to-know basis. Dissemination of information and/or written materials to persons not involved in the complaint procedure is not permitted. Violations of the privacy of the complainant or the accused individual may lead to conduct action by the College."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"In all complaints of sexual misconduct, all parties will be informed of the outcome. In some instances, the administration also may choose to make a brief public announcement of the nature of the violation and the action taken, without using the name or identifiable information of the alleged victim. Certain college administrators are informed of the outcome within the bounds of student privacy (e.g., the President of the College, Vice President of Student Services, Campus Security Officer). If there is a report of an act of alleged sexual misconduct to a conduct officer of the College and there is evidence that a felony has occurred, local police will be notified. This does not mean charges will be automatically filed or that a victim must speak with the police, but the institution is legally required to notify law enforcement authorities. The institution also must statistically report the occurrence on campus of major violent crimes, including certain sex offenses, in an annual report of campus crime statistics. This statistical report does not include personally identifiable information."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"All employees receiving reports of a potential violation of College policy are expected to promptly contact the Coordinator of Equity & Compliance, within 24 hours of becoming aware of a report or incident. All initial contacts will be treated with the maximum possible privacy; specific information on any grievances received by any party will be reported to the Coordinator of Equity & Compliance, but, subject to the College’s obligation to redress violations, every effort will be made to maintain the privacy of those initiating a report of a grievance. In all cases, the College will give consideration to the party bringing a grievance with respect to how the grievance is pursued, but reserves the right, when necessary to protect the community, to investigate and pursue a resolution when an alleged victim chooses not to initiate or participate in a formal grievance."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"Proceedings are private. All persons present at any time during the hearing are expected to maintain the privacy of the proceedings, subject to College consequences for failure to do so. While the contents of the hearing are private, the parties have discretion to share their own experiences if they so choose and should discuss doing so with their advocates."
 ,Sub link Page, ,"Hearings are recorded for purposes of review in the event of an appeal. EGP members, the parties and/or the persons who initiated the action, and appropriate administrative officers of the College will be allowed to listen to the recording in a location determined by the Coordinator of Equity & Compliance or designee. No person will be given or be allowed to make a copy of the recording without permission of the Coordinator of Equity & Compliance. Persons given access to the recording will be required to sign an agreement confirming that they will protect the privacy of the information contained in the recording."

On February 6, 2024, it was brought to the attention of the UT Southwestern Privacy Office that protected health information was shared with an unapproved third-party vendor called Code Kick AB, an online project management tool. Information including patient name, date of birth, medical record number, phone number, address or ZIP code, type of planned procedure, date of service of planned procedure, provider’s name, and insurance benefits information was unintentionally disclosed to the third-party vendor in an effort to track the completion of necessary insurance verification and gather any necessary prior authorizations. As soon as UT Southwestern became aware of the issue, we removed the information from the online tool and conducted an investigation. Based on our investigation, we do not have reason to believe that this information has been further compromised, has been used inappropriately by the third party, or shared outside the third-party software tool."

 ,Sub link Page,INFO 1260 / CS 1340: Choices and Consequences in Computing,"
        Computing requires difficult choices that can have serious implications
        for real people. This course covers a range of ethical, societal, and
        policy implications of computing and information. It draws on recent
        developments in digital technology and their impact on society,
        situating these in the context of fundamental principles from
        computing, policy, ethics, and the social sciences. A particular
        emphasis will be placed on large areas in which advances in computing
        have consistently raised societal challenges: privacy of individual
        data; fairness in algorithmic decision-making; dissemination of online
        content; and accountability in the design of computing systems. As this
        is an area in which the pace of technological development raises new
        challenges on a regular basis, the broader goal of the course is to
        enable students to develop their own analyses of new situations as they
        emerge at the interface of computing and societal interests.

 ,Sub link Page,Notices and Agreements | Caltech Academic Catalog,"2. Students are allowed access to their educational records as follows: A student may inspect and review their academic transcript during normal working hours. To inspect and review other records, the student must provide a written request to the registrar or to the director of financial aid or to the dean of graduate studies or to the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees, as appropriate. A mutually-convenient time will be arranged within 45 days after receipt of the request for the student to inspect and review the records in their file. At that time the student may examine all educational records in the file with the exception of those specifically exempted by Part 99 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. If circumstances effectively prevent the student from exercising their right to review their education records, the Institute will make other arrangements. If a student believes the educational records relating to the student contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student’s rights of privacy, the student may ask the Institute to amend the record. The Institute will decide whether to amend the records as requested within a reasonable time after receiving the request. If the registrar, or the director of financial aid, or the dean of graduate studies, or the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees, decide not to amend the record as requested, the student will be informed of the decision and of their right to a hearing. The student will have, on request, an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the content of the records on the grounds that the information contained in the records is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the privacy rights of the student. To request a hearing, the student must submit a written request to the vice president for student affairs or their designee. The vice president for student affairs or their designee will schedule such a hearing within a reasonable time after receipt of the request and will notify the student at a time reasonably in advance of the hearing of its date, time, and place. The student will be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assisted or represented by individuals of their choice at their own expense, including an attorney. The decision of the vice president or designee will be in writing, will be rendered within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and will be final. This decision will be based solely upon the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of the evidence and of the reasons for the decision. If, as a result of the hearing, the Institute decides that the information is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, the Institute will amend the record accordingly, and inform the student of the amendment in writing. However, if, as a result of the hearing, the Institute decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of a student, it will inform the student of the right to place in the educational records a statement commenting on the information in the records and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the Institute. If the Institute places a statement in the education records of the student, the Institute will maintain the statement with the contested part of the record for as long as the record is maintained and will disclose the statement whenever it discloses the portion of the record to which the statement relates."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"We do not collect Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (“SPII”) or Sensitive Consumer Information (“SCI”) about individual Users for any purpose. In other words, our DSP does not use SPII or SCI to target ads to individual Users. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, (i) SPII means any information that could be used to personally identify the User, such as the User’s name, Social Security Number, phone number (fixed or mobile), email address, credit card information, or any other data that could be used to personally identify the User; and (ii) SCI means sensitive information about a User such as financial account numbers, insurance plan numbers, or protected health information (PHI) as that term is defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. AdTheorent does store data that, in conjunction with other publicly accessible data, could be considered non-sensitive PII, such as IP Address, Cookie Ids and Device Advertising Ids (i.e., “non-sensitive PII”). This data is stored separately, and role-based access controls are in place which limit the linking or correlation of such data elements, and the Company does not use this data to seek to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"For purposes of this Privacy Policy SPII and SCI are referred to collectively as SPII and non-sensitive PII is referred to as PII. In addition, to the extent any of our Partners gather PII, we do not aggregate such information in a manner that could be used to identify any User. For example, in some instances we cross-reference non-sensitive PII information with a “hashed” version (i.e., a coded version) of a corresponding physical address or email address. We do this to provide more transparency to advertisers regarding the users who engaged with their ads and to provide more effective targeting (including in some cases identifying which devices correspond to the same unidentified User or which devices correspond to associates of such User (Cross-Device Linking)), and although we maintain statistical information about such Users' devices (""Device-Identified Information,""as defined below), or aggregate information not associated with any individual device or user (""Aggregate Infomation""), we do not create profiles of specific Users which include the identity of the User or include SPII or SCI."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent has appointed a Data Protection Officer who oversees AdTheorent’s technical infrastructure and process as such relate to privacy and data security matters. AdTheorent’s Data Protection Officer also participates as a member of the AdTheorent Privacy Task Force, which group is comprised of AdTheorent leadership individuals responsible for implementing and executing on the requirements described in this Policy. AdTheorent’s Data Protection Officer is reachable as described below under “Contact Us for More Information.”"
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,How We Meet Our Obligations Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy Directive
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent’s business focus is the United States market and most of our business activities to date relate to purchasing media impressions correlated to Users within the United States, but from time to time we also provide services to our clients related to international advertising campaigns, including campaigns in the European Union (the “EU”), in which case we may purchase digital media impressions and deliver digital ads to Users located in the EU. In such cases AdTheorent adheres to protocols, standards and rules described in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and ePrivacy Directive, as summarized below. AdTheorent has implemented a “compliance by design” approach to GDPR compliance which exceeds the requirements of the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, using de-identification and anonymization processes to prevent AdTheorent from using or storing Personal Data."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (an independent advisory body made up of representatives of the national data protection authorities, the European Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor), Opinion 06/2014, notes that retailers/advertisers have a legitimate interest in getting to know their customers’ preferences and marketing to them. While recognizing this legitimate interest, AdTheorent is also sensitive to the potential negative consequences for Users resulting from intrusions to their privacy. As a result, AdTheorent takes various affirmative steps to limit the types of Personal Data that is receives, to de-identify data and to use data in aggregated methods when possible."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,Applicability of ePrivacy Directive
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"Independent of GDPR, the EU ePrivacy Directive (and the new ePrivacy Regulation that is currently being negotiated) independently requires consent for AdTheorent’s Partners (and publishers generally) to be able to place cookies or otherwise access a User’s device. This type of consent, which is currently generally obtained through “cookie banners”, is still required despite GDPR. AdTheorent, like other ad tech companies, are not able to obtain this consent independently, so our contracts with Inventory Partners ensure that they obtain this consent (directly or through their participating publishers) on our behalf."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,How We Meet Our Obligations Under Canada’s Privacy Law - The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"To the extent that AdTheorent delivers digital advertisements related to advertising campaigns to Users located in Canada, AdTheorent complies with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (""PIPEDA""), which sets forth Canada’s federal private sector privacy law that governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of commercial activity as defined by the Act."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"As required under PIPEDA, AdTheorent considers the sensitivity of the Personal Data and Users’ reasonable expectations in determining the level of consent that must be obtained in connection with delivering advertisements to Users. In accessing and using third-party applications and web properties published by our Inventory Partners, Users consent to receiving advertisements as part of that experience, which is a reasonable expectation of such use. AdTheorent relies on such implied consent and advises Users to review the service terms and privacy policies associated with the web and app publications that such Users access and use in order to understand how Personal Data is collected, used, and disclosed by such third-party applications."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent has appointed a Privacy Officer/Data Protection Officer and Data Protection Team whose responsibilities include overseeing compliance with PIPEDA. For further information, contact information for the Privacy Officer can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"In addition to the above safeguards and processes, AdTheorent adheres to additional rules and best practices related to digital advertising in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. As noted above, AdTheorent does not obtain and therefore will not use (for any purpose, including but not limited to ad targeting or the development or refinement of predictive models) any Private Health Information (PHI) about any individual as that term is used under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the HIPAA Privacy Rule thereunder. AdTheorent healthcare and pharmaceutical campaigns may utilize contextual targeting techniques which may include geographic targeting and site-based targeting, and AdTheorent predictive models may be employed without using any PHI or Sensitive PII. To the extent AdTheorent leverages third party data to inform its predictive models and targeting strategies, such third parties do not provide or use PHI or Sensitive PII and AdTheorent will never receive or use PHI or Sensitive PII from such third parties. Rather, such third parties use aggregated metrics and de-identified data only."

The MSPA is an industry contractual framework intended to aid advertisers, publishers, agencies, and ad-tech intermediaries in complying with federal and state privacy laws in the United States. For transactions covered by the MSPA, “First Parties” (i.e., publishers and advertisers) can choose to operate in “Service Provider Mode” or “Opt-Out Option Mode,” depending your location in the United States and the disclosures and choices you are offered through “Choice Mechanisms.” Choice Mechanisms are ways to communicate restrictions on your consent to use of your personal information, such as “Do Not Sell or Share My Data” links. Service Provider Mode under the MSPA is for First Parties that do not “sell,” “share,” or process personal information for “targeted advertising.” Opt-Out Option Mode is for First Parties that may engage in those activities. Standards have been developed under the MSPA for technical signals to communicate your elections when you use Choice Mechanisms under applicable law to either consent or not consent to certain use of your personal information, and we honor those signals as we receive them in order to respect your choices."

 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters
      of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit,
      Inc. (""Reddit,"" ""we"" or ""us"") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use
      our websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services
      (collectively, the ""Services"") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a
      communication from us.
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit.
      We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries.
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      Privacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their data, account
      deletion, or information about our policies.
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
                        If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the
                        Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete
                        your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services
                        (e.g., Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are subject
                        to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will collect
                        information about the product or service you are purchasing (e.g., purchase
                        dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and renewal dates).
                      "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
                        Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For
                        example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or
                        tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't
                        have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how
                        third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly
                        via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this
                        privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is
                        embedded.

 ,Sub link Page,Adverty: Privacy Policy and personal data,"Adverty collects personal data in the course of our business. The definitions of personal data vary depending on the laws where you are located. For example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), personal data is defined broadly, and would include PII and Pseudonymous Identifiers (defined below). California’s privacy law defines personal information broadly, and would include PII and Pseudonymous Identifiers. Adverty will explain the different types of personal data below, and will try to be clear when we’re describing our use of each throughout this Policy."
 ,Sub link Page,Adverty: Privacy Policy and personal data,"We work with third-party data partners and advertising exchanges to enhance our advertising and targeting capabilities on the Platform. As determined by our partners’ business and privacy policies, we may also receive and retain information from partners’ Publishers including but not limited to: the current location of the device, third-party applications on the device or in use at the time of our advertising transaction with the device, the Users age, gender or other demographic indicator, and we may use or derive data obtained from third parties such as approximate location based on IP address to help match data sets, although such data is processed outside of our Platform. We also collect Pseudonymous Identifiers and other personal data over time and across multiple Publishers and use that information to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display advertisements that may be of interest to Users. Based on the privacy rules of the site or application owner and their business agreement with Adverty, we may integrate this Information with that acquired from other Publishers and third-party data providers. This information is then used to deliver advertisements and promotional information to the specific device identified based on the User’s online behavior or interests. This activity, called online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising, is currently limited to our advertising on mobile applications."

When we see those settings enacted on a mobile device, we treat that setting as a request to opt-out from interest based advertising and a request to opt-out from Adverty’s sale of data to third parties. Adverty works very hard to respect privacy and personal data and sees these global tools as having a damaging effect on your experience with advertising. There will always be advertising, so we believe that the best world is one where that ads are relevant to your interests and where you have granular control over which ad networks you trust with your personal data, not a tracking block for all ad networks."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"We do not collect Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (“SPII”) or Sensitive Consumer Information (“SCI”) about individual Users for any purpose. In other words, our DSP does not use SPII or SCI to target ads to individual Users. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, (i) SPII means any information that could be used to personally identify the User, such as the User’s name, Social Security Number, phone number (fixed or mobile), email address, credit card information, or any other data that could be used to personally identify the User; and (ii) SCI means sensitive information about a User such as financial account numbers, insurance plan numbers, or protected health information (PHI) as that term is defined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. AdTheorent does store data that, in conjunction with other publicly accessible data, could be considered non-sensitive PII, such as IP Address, Cookie Ids and Device Advertising Ids (i.e., “non-sensitive PII”). This data is stored separately, and role-based access controls are in place which limit the linking or correlation of such data elements, and the Company does not use this data to seek to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"To the extent any of our Partners (as defined below) gather PII, their privacy policies will govern its use."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"For purposes of this Privacy Policy SPII and SCI are referred to collectively as SPII and non-sensitive PII is referred to as PII. In addition, to the extent any of our Partners gather PII, we do not aggregate such information in a manner that could be used to identify any User. For example, in some instances we cross-reference non-sensitive PII information with a “hashed” version (i.e., a coded version) of a corresponding physical address or email address. We do this to provide more transparency to advertisers regarding the users who engaged with their ads and to provide more effective targeting (including in some cases identifying which devices correspond to the same unidentified User or which devices correspond to associates of such User (Cross-Device Linking)), and although we maintain statistical information about such Users' devices (""Device-Identified Information,""as defined below), or aggregate information not associated with any individual device or user (""Aggregate Infomation""), we do not create profiles of specific Users which include the identity of the User or include SPII or SCI."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent has appointed a Data Protection Officer who oversees AdTheorent’s technical infrastructure and process as such relate to privacy and data security matters. AdTheorent’s Data Protection Officer also participates as a member of the AdTheorent Privacy Task Force, which group is comprised of AdTheorent leadership individuals responsible for implementing and executing on the requirements described in this Policy.

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,How We Meet Our Obligations Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy Directive
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent’s business focus is the United States market and most of our business activities to date relate to purchasing media impressions correlated to Users within the United States, but from time to time we also provide services to our clients related to international advertising campaigns, including campaigns in the European Union (the “EU”), in which case we may purchase digital media impressions and deliver digital ads to Users located in the EU. In such cases AdTheorent adheres to protocols, standards and rules described in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and ePrivacy Directive, as summarized below. AdTheorent has implemented a “compliance by design” approach to GDPR compliance which exceeds the requirements of the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, using de-identification and anonymization processes to prevent AdTheorent from using or storing Personal Data."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (an independent advisory body made up of representatives of the national data protection authorities, the European Commission and the European Data Protection Supervisor), Opinion 06/2014, notes that retailers/advertisers have a legitimate interest in getting to know their customers’ preferences and marketing to them. While recognizing this legitimate interest, AdTheorent is also sensitive to the potential negative consequences for Users resulting from intrusions to their privacy. As a result, AdTheorent takes various affirmative steps to limit the types of Personal Data that is receives, to de-identify data and to use data in aggregated methods when possible."

 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,Applicability of ePrivacy Directive
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"Independent of GDPR, the EU ePrivacy Directive (and the new ePrivacy Regulation that is currently being negotiated) independently requires consent for AdTheorent’s Partners (and publishers generally) to be able to place cookies or otherwise access a User’s device. This type of consent, which is currently generally obtained through “cookie banners”, is still required despite GDPR. AdTheorent, like other ad tech companies, are not able to obtain this consent independently, so our contracts with Inventory Partners ensure that they obtain this consent (directly or through their participating publishers) on our behalf."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,How We Meet Our Obligations Under Canada’s Privacy Law - The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"To the extent that AdTheorent delivers digital advertisements related to advertising campaigns to Users located in Canada, AdTheorent complies with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (""PIPEDA""), which sets forth Canada’s federal private sector privacy law that governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of commercial activity as defined by the Act."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"As required under PIPEDA, AdTheorent considers the sensitivity of the Personal Data and Users’ reasonable expectations in determining the level of consent that must be obtained in connection with delivering advertisements to Users. In accessing and using third-party applications and web properties published by our Inventory Partners, Users consent to receiving advertisements as part of that experience, which is a reasonable expectation of such use. AdTheorent relies on such implied consent and advises Users to review the service terms and privacy policies associated with the web and app publications that such Users access and use in order to understand how Personal Data is collected, used, and disclosed by such third-party applications."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"AdTheorent has appointed a Privacy Officer/Data Protection Officer and Data Protection Team whose responsibilities include overseeing compliance with PIPEDA. For further information, contact information for the Privacy Officer can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,"In addition to the above safeguards and processes, AdTheorent adheres to additional rules and best practices related to digital advertising in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. As noted above, AdTheorent does not obtain and therefore will not use (for any purpose, including but not limited to ad targeting or the development or refinement of predictive models) any Private Health Information (PHI) about any individual as that term is used under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the HIPAA Privacy Rule thereunder. AdTheorent healthcare and pharmaceutical campaigns may utilize contextual targeting techniques which may include geographic targeting and site-based targeting, and AdTheorent predictive models may be employed without using any PHI or Sensitive PII. To the extent AdTheorent leverages third party data to inform its predictive models and targeting strategies, such third parties do not provide or use PHI or Sensitive PII and AdTheorent will never receive or use PHI or Sensitive PII from such third parties. Rather, such third parties use aggregated metrics and de-identified data only."
 ,Sub link Page,Privacy Policy | AdTheorent,AdTheorent leverages aggregate third-party data to access NPI-level information for the purpose of targeting health care providers (HCP).  Our third party partner maintains a privacy policy to ensure the appropriate opt-in and opt-out safeguards for HCP data.

For transactions covered by the MSPA, “First Parties” (i.e., publishers and advertisers) can choose to operate in “Service Provider Mode” or “Opt-Out Option Mode,” depending your location in the United States and the disclosures and choices you are offered through “Choice Mechanisms.” Choice Mechanisms are ways to communicate restrictions on your consent to use of your personal information, such as “Do Not Sell or Share My Data” links. Service Provider Mode under the MSPA is for First Parties that do not “sell,” “share,” or process personal information for “targeted advertising.” Opt-Out Option Mode is for First Parties that may engage in those activities.

 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters
      of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit,
      Inc. (""Reddit,"" ""we"" or ""us"") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use
      our websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services
      (collectively, the ""Services"") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a
      communication from us.
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit.
      We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,All of our users get privacy rights - not just those in select countries.
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
      Privacy rights are for everyone. At Reddit, anyone can request a copy of their data, account
      deletion, or information about our policies.
    "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
                        If you purchase products or services from us or otherwise through the
                        Services, you will have to provide payment information in order to complete
                        your purchase. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services
                        (e.g., Stripe) to handle payment information, and those services are subject
                        to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies. We will collect
                        information about the product or service you are purchasing (e.g., purchase
                        dates, amounts paid or received, and expiration and renewal dates).
                      "
 ,Sub link Page,Reddit - Dive into anything,"
                        Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Services via embeds. For
                        example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or X may load the linked video or
                        tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't
                        have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how
                        third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly
                        via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this

 ,Sub link Page,Student Consumer Information | Avila University,"The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of the student’s right to privacy. Students may request an amendment to the educational record by submitting a request in writing to the University Registrar. The request must state the specific portion of the education records the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of their privacy rights and, if appropriate, state the correct information that should be in the records. After a review of the student’s request, the student will receive a decision in writing. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the notification to the student will advise the student of his or her right to a hearing, and the hearing procedures. NOTE: The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act was not intended to provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments that are correctly recorded. Under this, students may not request an amendment to grades that are recorded as issued by the faculty, outcomes to disciplinary hearings, reflections, or judgments recorded as part of an evaluation process, or other judgments correctly recorded. Students must refer to other institutional procedures to address these concerns."
 ,Sub link Page,General Information - Avila University - Modern Campus Catalog™,"If the student believes that inaccurate or misleading information is contained in the educational record, or that the information is in violation of the student’s rights of privacy, the student may submit a written request to the administrator of the office responsible for that record. The written request submitted should include the part of the record that is believed to need change and why it is believed the information is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation. The university will investigate the request and notify the student of the decision. If the record is not amended as requested, the student has the right to request a hearing."

 ,Sub link Page,Lane College | Title IX,"The College recognizes that a sexual assault is more than an assault on an individual’s body, but is also an invasion on the individual’s dignity and sense of self. Out of respect for the individual choices available to a sexual assault victim and to support her/his privacy needs after an incident, the College leaves the decision to file a formal student complaint, a formal sexual harassment complaint, or criminal charges up to the individual victim. Resources for assistance will be discussed, but all members of the College community will abstain from demanding that the victim report, not report, or under-report a sexual assault. The College reserves it right to investigate an incident using all available information from any source and will cooperate with the efforts of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to apprehend individuals who may have committed acts of sexual assault."
 ,Sub link Page,Lane College | Title IX,"Lane College believes that a well-informed community can better prevent the incidence of sexual assault. The Division for Student Affairs, in conjunction with the Office of the Title IX Coordinator, will give timely notice to the College community when an assault or attempted assault is reported on campus so that the community can take appropriate steps to prevent this type of activity in the future. This notice will be given through the e2Campus Emergency Notification System, email, postings, or a combination of these communication vehicles. The name of the victim will not be released by the Vice President for Student Affairs in any notifications to the community members informing them of information pertaining to the offense. Also, such notifications will not include information that would cause the victim to be notified. Thus, the College will strive to balance its concerns for the privacy of victims of sexual assault with its duty to warn members of the Lane College community when serious crimes are reported."
