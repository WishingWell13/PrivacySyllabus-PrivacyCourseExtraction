Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"We raden u aan deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen in zijn geheel te lezen om ervoor te zorgen dat u volledig op de hoogte bent. Om het echter gemakkelijker voor u te maken om specifieke delen van deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen te vinden en te bekijken, hebben we deze onderverdeeld in de volgende secties:"
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,Updaten we deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen?
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,Updaten we deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen?
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Wij geloven in een sterke bescherming van de privacy van elke persoon van wie wij informatie verwerken, in welke hoedanigheid dan ook – omdat wij geloven dat privacy een fundamenteel recht is, en niet iets dat moet afhangen van waar u woont. Om aan dat beginsel te voldoen, behandelen wij alle gegevens die betrekking hebben op of gekoppeld zijn aan een geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke persoon als “Persoonsgegevens”, ongeacht de locatie van die persoon. Wat onze Oplossingen betreft, beperkt DoubleVerify alle informatie die wij verzamelen tot informatie die het niet mogelijk maakt een individu te identificeren zonder aanvullende informatie. DoubleVerify verwerkt bijvoorbeeld uw Internet Protocol (“IP”)-adres, een nummer dat automatisch aan een computer wordt toegekend wanneer het internet wordt gebruikt. Hoewel DoubleVerify dergelijke informatie behandelt als Persoonsgegevens, in overeenstemming met de beste praktijken en toepasselijke wetgeving, combineren wij deze informatie nooit met andere gegevens die ons in staat zouden stellen de persoon op wie de informatie betrekking heeft te identificeren."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Met uitzondering van Fraudebestrijding, inclusief zoals vereist om indrukken te kwalificeren volgens standaardbedrijfspraktijken (bijv. richtlijnen van de Media Ratings Council) en Geo-verificatie, vereisen de andere Oplossingen van DoubleVerify (zoals zichtbaarheid, merkveiligheid en geschiktheid) over het algemeen niet de verwerking van Persoonsgegevens. Er zijn echter omstandigheden, zoals gevallen waarin wij dergelijke Oplossingen aan Klanten kunnen leveren die “walled gardens” exploiteren, waar deze Klanten, in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken, mogelijk kunnen verlangen dat DoubleVerify aanvullende Persoonsgegevens verwerkt van Eindgebruikers of individuen die accounts en inhoud creëren binnen de omgevingen van de Klant. In een dergelijk scenario wordt door de Klanten bepaald welke Persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, die in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken ook, naar eigen goeddunken, de rechtsgrondslag voor de verwerking van dergelijke Persoonsgegevens bepalen. Voor meer informatie over de privacypraktijken van deze Klanten, de Persoonsgegevens die worden verwerkt en de toepasselijke rechtsgrondslag voor verwerking, dient u de relevante en toepasselijke privacykennisgeving of -verklaringen van elke Klant te raadplegen. Als u contact opneemt met DoubleVerify om te informeren naar deze programma’s, kunnen we enige basisinformatie geven over het werk dat we voor deze Klanten doen, maar we zullen u aanraden contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de privacydocumentatie te bekijken die zij beschikbaar maken op hun kanalen."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,Privacykeuzes opslaan en communiceren (Speciaal Doel 3)
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"In beperkte omstandigheden kan DoubleVerify door sommige van haar Klanten, bijvoorbeeld Klanten die als “walled garden(s)” opereren, worden verzocht aanvullende Persoonsgegevens te verwerken om haar Oplossingen mogelijk te maken. Dergelijke aanvullende Persoonsgegevens kunnen betrekking hebben op Eindgebruikers, op individuen die accounts aanmaken binnen dergelijke “walled gardens” of op individuen die inhoud creëren die binnen dergelijke “walled garden”-omgevingen wordt gepubliceerd. Voor zover DoubleVerify door een van haar Klanten die als “walled gardens” opereren, wordt verzocht aanvullende Persoonsgegevens te verwerken om bepaalde Oplossingen mogelijk te maken, zal DoubleVerify deze Persoonsgegevens uitsluitend verwerken om aan haar verplichtingen jegens de Klant te voldoen en strikt in overeenstemming met de instructies van de Klant, zoals vereist om de Oplossingen te exploiteren, te onderhouden en, indien van toepassing, te verbeteren. Wij werken nauw samen met deze Klanten om ervoor te zorgen dat de verwerkte Persoonsgegevens beperkt blijven tot de Persoonsgegevens die nodig zijn om deze doeleinden te bereiken. Onder beperkte omstandigheden kan onze interactie met “walled gardens” incidenteel tot de ontvangst van persoonsgegevens leiden. DoubleVerify werkt er hard aan om toezicht te houden op dergelijke gevallen om ervoor te zorgen dat de betreffende persoonsgegevens na ontvangst niet worden verwerkt, behalve om ze veilig uit onze systemen te verwijderen. Aangezien in deze scenario’s de specifieke categorieën van Persoonsgegevens afhankelijk zijn van de aangepaste integratie en beslissingen van de Klant, en variëren van Klant tot Klant, raden wij u aan, indien u verdere vragen heeft, contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de documentatie over privacy te raadplegen die deze beschikbaar stelt op haar kanalen."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"U dient zich ervan bewust te zijn dat de door ons verzamelde Persoonsgegevens kunnen worden overgedragen aan en bewaard op servers of databases die zich buiten uw staat, provincie, land of ander rechtsgebied bevinden. Hoewel uw Persoonsgegevens via een lokaal tijdelijk datacentrum kunnen worden verzonden om ervoor te zorgen dat de Oplossingen efficiënt en responsief zijn, slaat DoubleVerify alle via de Oplossingen verzamelde Persoonsgegevens uiteindelijk op in de Verenigde Staten. Als wereldwijd bedrijf hebben wij kantoren in de Verenigde Staten, het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Frankrijk, België, Finland, Duitsland, Israël, Canada, Mexico, Brazilië, Japan, India, Singapore en Australië. Onze werknemers op deze locaties kunnen toegang nodig hebben tot uw Persoonsgegevens om onze Oplossingen te ondersteunen.

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Bepaalde privacywetten en -voorschriften, zoals de CCPA, vereisen dat bedrijven bekendmaken of zij Persoonsgegevens verkopen.

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"DoubleVerify gebruikt kunstmatige intelligentie (“AI”) in verschillende hoedanigheden en op verschillende manieren binnen de hele organisatie.

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Crediamo nella possibilità di garantire forti protezioni in termini di privacy a qualsiasi individuo del quale potremmo trattare le informazioni in qualsiasi veste, perché riteniamo che la privacy sia un diritto fondamentale e non dovrebbe dipendere da dove vive l’Utente. In ottemperanza a tale principio, trattiamo tutti i dati che si riferiscono o sono collegati a un individuo identificato o identificabile come “Informazioni personali”, indipendentemente dalla posizione di tale individuo. In relazione alle nostre Soluzioni, DoubleVerify limita tutte le informazioni che raccoglie alle informazioni che non consentono l’identificazione di una persona senza ulteriori informazioni. Per esempio DoubleVerify tratta l’indirizzo del protocollo internet (“IP”) dell’Utente, ovvero un numero assegnato automaticamente a un computer quando si utilizza Internet. DoubleVerify tratta tali informazioni come Informazioni personali, in conformità con le migliori prassi nonché le leggi applicabili, ma in nessun momento le abbina ad altri dati che le consentirebbero di identificare l’individuo a cui tali informazioni si riferiscono."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Fatta eccezione per l’Eliminazione delle frodi, compreso quanto richiesto per qualificare le impressioni secondo le pratiche standard del settore (ad esempio, le linee guida del Media Ratings Council), e la Verifica geografica, le altre Soluzioni di DoubleVerify (come la viewability, la brand safety e suitability) non richiedono in genere il trattamento di Informazioni personali. Tuttavia, ci sono casi, ad esempio, in cui potremmo fornire Soluzioni di questo tipo ai Clienti che gestiscono “walled garden”; questi Clienti, nel proprio ruolo di titolari del trattamento, potrebbero necessitare del trattamento, da parte di DoubleVerify, di Informazioni personali aggiuntive degli Utenti finali o di individui che creano account e contenuti all’interno degli ambienti dei Clienti. In una situazione di questo genere, sono i Clienti a determinare quali Informazioni personali verranno trattate nonché, a loro esclusiva discrezione, la base giuridica del trattamento delle stesse. Per ulteriori informazioni su queste prassi di privacy dei Clienti, le Informazioni personali trattate e la base giuridica applicabile al trattamento, l’Utente può consultare le pertinenti informative o dichiarazioni sulla privacy. Se l’Utente contatta DoubleVerify per chiedere informazioni su questi programmi, potremo fornirgli alcune informazioni di base sul lavoro che svolgiamo per questi Clienti, ma suggeriamo che l’Utente contatti direttamente il Cliente specifico o ne consulti la documentazione privacy che lo stesso mette a disposizione sulle sue proprietà."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"As used in this Reporting Tools Privacy Notice, “Personal Information” means information that relates to an identified individual or to an identifiable individual. We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live. To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"The purpose of this Reporting Tools Privacy Notice is to inform you of DoubleVerify’s privacy practices, particularly our approach to the use, collection, and sharing of your Personal Information processed via our Reporting Tools, as well as your privacy rights and how to exercise them.

Our employees at these locations may be required to access your Personal Information to support our operations. The level of data protection established in some of these locations, such as the United States, may be lower than the one established in the European Union or other jurisdictions that have enacted strong privacy laws and regulations. We take measures to ensure that your Personal Information is stored safely with us, meeting regulatory privacy and security requirements imposed on European Union businesses. We also ensure that any other recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission or other applicable regulator."

Because videos and ads are essential parts of the Dailymotion Service you access, it is also normal and expected that a user’s data is processed to deliver them. Limited use of your personal data to ensure security and to deliver content and ads cannot be opposed to as it would result in unavailability of our Service."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"We recommend that you read this Solutions Privacy Notice in its entirety to ensure you are fully informed. However, to make it easier for you to find and review specific parts of this Solutions Privacy Notice, we have it divided up into the following sections:"

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live. To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location. As it relates to our Solutions, DoubleVerify limits any information we collect to information that does not allow the identification of an individual without additional information. For example, DoubleVerify processes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when the Internet is used. While DoubleVerify treats such information as Personal Information, in accordance with best practices and applicable laws, we never combine that information with any other data that would enable us to identify the individual to whom it relates."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Except for Fraud Elimination, including as required to qualify impressions according to standard industry practices (e.g., Media Ratings Council guidelines), and Geo Verification, DoubleVerify’s other Solutions (such as viewability, brand safety and suitability) do not generally require the processing of Personal Information. However, there are circumstances, such as instances where we may provide such Solutions to Customers that operate “walled gardens”, where these Customers, in their role as controllers, may require DoubleVerify to process additional Personal Information of End Users or individuals who create accounts and content within the Customer’s environments. In any such scenario, the determination as to what Personal Data is processed is made by the Customers, who in their role of controllers, also determine, in their sole discretion, the legal basis of processing of such Personal Information. For further information about these Customers’ privacy practices, the Personal Information processed and the applicable legal basis of processing, you should review each Customer’s relevant and applicable privacy notice or statements. If you contact DoubleVerify to inquire about these programs, we can provide some basic information about the work we do for these Customers, but we will recommend that you contact the individual Customer or review the privacy documentation they make available on their properties."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"In limited circumstances, DoubleVerify may be required by some of its Customers, for example Customers that operates as a “walled garden(s)”, to process additional Personal Information to enable its Solutions. Such additional Personal Information may relate to End Users, to individuals who create accounts within such “walled gardens” or individuals who create content that is published within such “walled garden” environments. To the extent DoubleVerify is required by one of its Customers that operate as “walled gardens” to process additional Personal Information to enable certain Solutions, DoubleVerify shall process such Personal Information solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations to the Customer and strictly in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, as required to operate, maintain and, where applicable, improve the Solutions. We work diligently with these Customers to ensure the Personal Information processed is limited only to the Personal Information necessary to achieve these purposes. In limited circumstances, our interaction with “walled gardens” may result in incidental receipt of Personal Information. DoubleVerify works diligently to monitor any such instances to ensure such Personal Information is not processed beyond receipt except to securely purge it from our systems. Since in these scenarios the specific categories of Personal Information are dependent on the custom integration and decisions of the Customer, and vary from Customer to Customer, if you have further questions, we recommend that you contact the individual Customer or review the privacy documentation they make available on their properties."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Please be aware that the Personal Information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction. While your Personal Information may be transmitted through a local temporary data center to ensure the Solutions are efficient and responsive, DoubleVerify ultimately stores all Personal Information collected through the Solutions in the United States. As a global company, we have office locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Israel, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, India, Singapore and Australia. Our employees at these locations may be required to access your Personal Information to support our Solutions.

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"We raden u aan deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen in zijn geheel te lezen om ervoor te zorgen dat u volledig op de hoogte bent. Om het echter gemakkelijker voor u te maken om specifieke delen van deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen te vinden en te bekijken, hebben we deze onderverdeeld in de volgende secties:"

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,Updaten we deze Privacyverklaring voor Oplossingen?
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Wij geloven in een sterke bescherming van de privacy van elke persoon van wie wij informatie verwerken, in welke hoedanigheid dan ook – omdat wij geloven dat privacy een fundamenteel recht is, en niet iets dat moet afhangen van waar u woont. Om aan dat beginsel te voldoen, behandelen wij alle gegevens die betrekking hebben op of gekoppeld zijn aan een geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke persoon als “Persoonsgegevens”, ongeacht de locatie van die persoon. Wat onze Oplossingen betreft, beperkt DoubleVerify alle informatie die wij verzamelen tot informatie die het niet mogelijk maakt een individu te identificeren zonder aanvullende informatie. DoubleVerify verwerkt bijvoorbeeld uw Internet Protocol (“IP”)-adres, een nummer dat automatisch aan een computer wordt toegekend wanneer het internet wordt gebruikt. Hoewel DoubleVerify dergelijke informatie behandelt als Persoonsgegevens, in overeenstemming met de beste praktijken en toepasselijke wetgeving, combineren wij deze informatie nooit met andere gegevens die ons in staat zouden stellen de persoon op wie de informatie betrekking heeft te identificeren."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Met uitzondering van Fraudebestrijding, inclusief zoals vereist om indrukken te kwalificeren volgens standaardbedrijfspraktijken (bijv. richtlijnen van de Media Ratings Council) en Geo-verificatie, vereisen de andere Oplossingen van DoubleVerify (zoals zichtbaarheid, merkveiligheid en geschiktheid) over het algemeen niet de verwerking van Persoonsgegevens. Er zijn echter omstandigheden, zoals gevallen waarin wij dergelijke Oplossingen aan Klanten kunnen leveren die “walled gardens” exploiteren, waar deze Klanten, in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken, mogelijk kunnen verlangen dat DoubleVerify aanvullende Persoonsgegevens verwerkt van Eindgebruikers of individuen die accounts en inhoud creëren binnen de omgevingen van de Klant. In een dergelijk scenario wordt door de Klanten bepaald welke Persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, die in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken ook, naar eigen goeddunken, de rechtsgrondslag voor de verwerking van dergelijke Persoonsgegevens bepalen. Voor meer informatie over de privacypraktijken van deze Klanten, de Persoonsgegevens die worden verwerkt en de toepasselijke rechtsgrondslag voor verwerking, dient u de relevante en toepasselijke privacykennisgeving of -verklaringen van elke Klant te raadplegen. Als u contact opneemt met DoubleVerify om te informeren naar deze programma’s, kunnen we enige basisinformatie geven over het werk dat we voor deze Klanten doen, maar we zullen u aanraden contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de privacydocumentatie te bekijken die zij beschikbaar maken op hun kanalen."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,Privacykeuzes opslaan en communiceren (Speciaal Doel 3)
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"In beperkte omstandigheden kan DoubleVerify door sommige van haar Klanten, bijvoorbeeld Klanten die als “walled garden(s)” opereren, worden verzocht aanvullende Persoonsgegevens te verwerken om haar Oplossingen mogelijk te maken. Dergelijke aanvullende Persoonsgegevens kunnen betrekking hebben op Eindgebruikers, op individuen die accounts aanmaken binnen dergelijke “walled gardens” of op individuen die inhoud creëren die binnen dergelijke “walled garden”-omgevingen wordt gepubliceerd. Voor zover DoubleVerify door een van haar Klanten die als “walled gardens” opereren, wordt verzocht aanvullende Persoonsgegevens te verwerken om bepaalde Oplossingen mogelijk te maken, zal DoubleVerify deze Persoonsgegevens uitsluitend verwerken om aan haar verplichtingen jegens de Klant te voldoen en strikt in overeenstemming met de instructies van de Klant, zoals vereist om de Oplossingen te exploiteren, te onderhouden en, indien van toepassing, te verbeteren. Wij werken nauw samen met deze Klanten om ervoor te zorgen dat de verwerkte Persoonsgegevens beperkt blijven tot de Persoonsgegevens die nodig zijn om deze doeleinden te bereiken. Onder beperkte omstandigheden kan onze interactie met “walled gardens” incidenteel tot de ontvangst van persoonsgegevens leiden. DoubleVerify werkt er hard aan om toezicht te houden op dergelijke gevallen om ervoor te zorgen dat de betreffende persoonsgegevens na ontvangst niet worden verwerkt, behalve om ze veilig uit onze systemen te verwijderen. Aangezien in deze scenario’s de specifieke categorieën van Persoonsgegevens afhankelijk zijn van de aangepaste integratie en beslissingen van de Klant, en variëren van Klant tot Klant, raden wij u aan, indien u verdere vragen heeft, contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de documentatie over privacy te raadplegen die deze beschikbaar stelt op haar kanalen."

In ottemperanza a tale principio, trattiamo tutti i dati che si riferiscono o sono collegati a un individuo identificato o identificabile come “Informazioni personali”, indipendentemente dalla posizione di tale individuo. In relazione alle nostre Soluzioni, DoubleVerify limita tutte le informazioni che raccoglie alle informazioni che non consentono l’identificazione di una persona senza ulteriori informazioni. Per esempio DoubleVerify tratta l’indirizzo del protocollo internet (“IP”) dell’Utente, ovvero un numero assegnato automaticamente a un computer quando si utilizza Internet. DoubleVerify tratta tali informazioni come Informazioni personali, in conformità con le migliori prassi nonché le leggi applicabili, ma in nessun momento le abbina ad altri dati che le consentirebbero di identificare l’individuo a cui tali informazioni si riferiscono."

Tuttavia, ci sono casi, ad esempio, in cui potremmo fornire Soluzioni di questo tipo ai Clienti che gestiscono “walled garden”; questi Clienti, nel proprio ruolo di titolari del trattamento, potrebbero necessitare del trattamento, da parte di DoubleVerify, di Informazioni personali aggiuntive degli Utenti finali o di individui che creano account e contenuti all’interno degli ambienti dei Clienti. In una situazione di questo genere, sono i Clienti a determinare quali Informazioni personali verranno trattate nonché, a loro esclusiva discrezione, la base giuridica del trattamento delle stesse. Per ulteriori informazioni su queste prassi di privacy dei Clienti, le Informazioni personali trattate e la base giuridica applicabile al trattamento, l’Utente può consultare le pertinenti informative o dichiarazioni sulla privacy. Se l’Utente contatta DoubleVerify per chiedere informazioni su questi programmi, potremo fornirgli alcune informazioni di base sul lavoro che svolgiamo per questi Clienti, ma suggeriamo che l’Utente contatti direttamente il Cliente specifico o ne consulti la documentazione privacy che lo stesso mette a disposizione sulle sue proprietà."

Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"As used in this Reporting Tools Privacy Notice, “Personal Information” means information that relates to an identified individual or to an identifiable individual. We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live. To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location."
Welch College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"The purpose of this Reporting Tools Privacy Notice is to inform you of DoubleVerify’s privacy practices, particularly our approach to the use, collection, and sharing of your Personal Information processed via our Reporting Tools, as well as your privacy rights and how to exercise them.

As a global company, we have office locations in many countries, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, the UAE, France, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Israel, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, India, Singapore and Australia. Our employees at these locations may be required to access your Personal Information to support our operations. The level of data protection established in some of these locations, such as the United States, may be lower than the one established in the European Union or other jurisdictions that have enacted strong privacy laws and regulations. We take measures to ensure that your Personal Information is stored safely with us, meeting regulatory privacy and security requirements imposed on European Union businesses. We also ensure that any other recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission or other applicable regulator."

Welch College,Sub Link,Opera Privacy Statement,"This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us."
Welch College,Sub Link,Opera Privacy Statement,"The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law."
Welch College,Sub Link,Opera Privacy Statement,"First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity."
Welch College,Sub Link,Opera Privacy Statement,"Legitimate interest: When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy."

As it relates to our Solutions, DoubleVerify limits any information we collect to information that does not allow the identification of an individual without additional information. For example, DoubleVerify processes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when the Internet is used. While DoubleVerify treats such information as Personal Information, in accordance with best practices and applicable laws, we never combine that information with any other data that would enable us to identify the individual to whom it relates."

However, there are circumstances, such as instances where we may provide such Solutions to Customers that operate “walled gardens”, where these Customers, in their role as controllers, may require DoubleVerify to process additional Personal Information of End Users or individuals who create accounts and content within the Customer’s environments. In any such scenario, the determination as to what Personal Data is processed is made by the Customers, who in their role of controllers, also determine, in their sole discretion, the legal basis of processing of such Personal Information.

Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Wij geloven in een sterke bescherming van de privacy van elke persoon van wie wij informatie verwerken, in welke hoedanigheid dan ook – omdat wij geloven dat privacy een fundamenteel recht is, en niet iets dat moet afhangen van waar u woont. Om aan dat beginsel te voldoen, behandelen wij alle gegevens die betrekking hebben op of gekoppeld zijn aan een geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke persoon als “Persoonsgegevens”, ongeacht de locatie van die persoon. Wat onze Oplossingen betreft, beperkt DoubleVerify alle informatie die wij verzamelen tot informatie die het niet mogelijk maakt een individu te identificeren zonder aanvullende informatie. DoubleVerify verwerkt bijvoorbeeld uw Internet Protocol (“IP”)-adres, een nummer dat automatisch aan een computer wordt toegekend wanneer het internet wordt gebruikt. Hoewel DoubleVerify dergelijke informatie behandelt als Persoonsgegevens, in overeenstemming met de beste praktijken en toepasselijke wetgeving, combineren wij deze informatie nooit met andere gegevens die ons in staat zouden stellen de persoon op wie de informatie betrekking heeft te identificeren."

Er zijn echter omstandigheden, zoals gevallen waarin wij dergelijke Oplossingen aan Klanten kunnen leveren die “walled gardens” exploiteren, waar deze Klanten, in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken, mogelijk kunnen verlangen dat DoubleVerify aanvullende Persoonsgegevens verwerkt van Eindgebruikers of individuen die accounts en inhoud creëren binnen de omgevingen van de Klant. In een dergelijk scenario wordt door de Klanten bepaald welke Persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, die in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken ook, naar eigen goeddunken, de rechtsgrondslag voor de verwerking van dergelijke Persoonsgegevens bepalen. Voor meer informatie over de privacypraktijken van deze Klanten, de Persoonsgegevens die worden verwerkt en de toepasselijke rechtsgrondslag voor verwerking, dient u de relevante en toepasselijke privacykennisgeving of -verklaringen van elke Klant te raadplegen. Als u contact opneemt met DoubleVerify om te informeren naar deze programma’s, kunnen we enige basisinformatie geven over het werk dat we voor deze Klanten doen, maar we zullen u aanraden contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de privacydocumentatie te bekijken die zij beschikbaar maken op hun kanalen."

DoubleVerify werkt er hard aan om toezicht te houden op dergelijke gevallen om ervoor te zorgen dat de betreffende persoonsgegevens na ontvangst niet worden verwerkt, behalve om ze veilig uit onze systemen te verwijderen.

Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live. To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location. As it relates to our Solutions, DoubleVerify limits any information we collect to information that does not allow the identification of an individual without additional information. For example, DoubleVerify processes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when the Internet is used. While DoubleVerify treats such information as Personal Information, in accordance with best practices and applicable laws, we never combine that information with any other data that would enable us to identify the individual to whom it relates."
Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Except for Fraud Elimination, including as required to qualify impressions according to standard industry practices (e.g., Media Ratings Council guidelines), and Geo Verification, DoubleVerify’s other Solutions (such as viewability, brand safety and suitability) do not generally require the processing of Personal Information. However, there are circumstances, such as instances where we may provide such Solutions to Customers that operate “walled gardens”, where these Customers, in their role as controllers, may require DoubleVerify to process additional Personal Information of End Users or individuals who create accounts and content within the Customer’s environments. In any such scenario, the determination as to what Personal Data is processed is made by the Customers, who in their role of controllers, also determine, in their sole discretion, the legal basis of processing of such Personal Information. For further information about these Customers’ privacy practices, the Personal Information processed and the applicable legal basis of processing, you should review each Customer’s relevant and applicable privacy notice or statements. If you contact DoubleVerify to inquire about these programs, we can provide some basic information about the work we do for these Customers, but we will recommend that you contact the individual Customer or review the privacy documentation they make available on their properties."

Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"In limited circumstances, DoubleVerify may be required by some of its Customers, for example Customers that operates as a “walled garden(s)”, to process additional Personal Information to enable its Solutions. Such additional Personal Information may relate to End Users, to individuals who create accounts within such “walled gardens” or individuals who create content that is published within such “walled garden” environments. To the extent DoubleVerify is required by one of its Customers that operate as “walled gardens” to process additional Personal Information to enable certain Solutions, DoubleVerify shall process such Personal Information solely for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations to the Customer and strictly in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, as required to operate, maintain and, where applicable, improve the Solutions. We work diligently with these Customers to ensure the Personal Information processed is limited only to the Personal Information necessary to achieve these purposes. In limited circumstances, our interaction with “walled gardens” may result in incidental receipt of Personal Information. DoubleVerify works diligently to monitor any such instances to ensure such Personal Information is not processed beyond receipt except to securely purge it from our systems. Since in these scenarios the specific categories of Personal Information are dependent on the custom integration and decisions of the Customer, and vary from Customer to Customer, if you have further questions, we recommend that you contact the individual Customer or review the privacy documentation they make available on their properties."

Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"Wij geloven in een sterke bescherming van de privacy van elke persoon van wie wij informatie verwerken, in welke hoedanigheid dan ook – omdat wij geloven dat privacy een fundamenteel recht is, en niet iets dat moet afhangen van waar u woont. Om aan dat beginsel te voldoen, behandelen wij alle gegevens die betrekking hebben op of gekoppeld zijn aan een geïdentificeerde of identificeerbare natuurlijke persoon als “Persoonsgegevens”, ongeacht de locatie van die persoon. Wat onze Oplossingen betreft, beperkt DoubleVerify alle informatie die wij verzamelen tot informatie die het niet mogelijk maakt een individu te identificeren zonder aanvullende informatie. DoubleVerify verwerkt bijvoorbeeld uw Internet Protocol (“IP”)-adres, een nummer dat automatisch aan een computer wordt toegekend wanneer het internet wordt gebruikt. Hoewel DoubleVerify dergelijke informatie behandelt als Persoonsgegevens, in overeenstemming met de beste praktijken en toepasselijke wetgeving, combineren wij deze informatie nooit met andere gegevens die ons in staat zouden stellen de persoon op wie de informatie betrekking heeft te identificeren."

Er zijn echter omstandigheden, zoals gevallen waarin wij dergelijke Oplossingen aan Klanten kunnen leveren die “walled gardens” exploiteren, waar deze Klanten, in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken, mogelijk kunnen verlangen dat DoubleVerify aanvullende Persoonsgegevens verwerkt van Eindgebruikers of individuen die accounts en inhoud creëren binnen de omgevingen van de Klant. In een dergelijk scenario wordt door de Klanten bepaald welke Persoonsgegevens worden verwerkt, die in hun rol als verwerkingsverantwoordelijken ook, naar eigen goeddunken, de rechtsgrondslag voor de verwerking van dergelijke Persoonsgegevens bepalen. Voor meer informatie over de privacypraktijken van deze Klanten, de Persoonsgegevens die worden verwerkt en de toepasselijke rechtsgrondslag voor verwerking, dient u de relevante en toepasselijke privacykennisgeving of -verklaringen van elke Klant te raadplegen. Als u contact opneemt met DoubleVerify om te informeren naar deze programma’s, kunnen we enige basisinformatie geven over het werk dat we voor deze Klanten doen, maar we zullen u aanraden contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de privacydocumentatie te bekijken die zij beschikbaar maken op hun kanalen."

DoubleVerify werkt er hard aan om toezicht te houden op dergelijke gevallen om ervoor te zorgen dat de betreffende persoonsgegevens na ontvangst niet worden verwerkt, behalve om ze veilig uit onze systemen te verwijderen. Aangezien in deze scenario’s de specifieke categorieën van Persoonsgegevens afhankelijk zijn van de aangepaste integratie en beslissingen van de Klant, en variëren van Klant tot Klant, raden wij u aan, indien u verdere vragen heeft, contact op te nemen met de individuele Klant of de documentatie over privacy te raadplegen die deze beschikbaar stelt op haar kanalen."

Granite State College,Sub Link,Privacy Notice - DoubleVerify,"As used in this Reporting Tools Privacy Notice, “Personal Information” means information that relates to an identified individual or to an identifiable individual. We believe in providing strong privacy protections to any individual whose information we may process in any capacity – because we believe privacy is a fundamental right, not something that should depend on where you may live. To live up to that principle, we treat any data that relates or is linked to an identified or identifiable individual as “Personal Information” regardless of that individual’s location."

Our employees at these locations may be required to access your Personal Information to support our operations. The level of data protection established in some of these locations, such as the United States, may be lower than the one established in the European Union or other jurisdictions that have enacted strong privacy laws and regulations. We take measures to ensure that your Personal Information is stored safely with us, meeting regulatory privacy and security requirements imposed on European Union businesses. We also ensure that any other recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of protection and security, for instance by entering into the appropriate back-to-back agreements and, if required, standard contractual clauses or an alternative mechanism for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission or other applicable regulator."
